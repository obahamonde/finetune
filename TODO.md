# Task Plan: OpenAI Fine-tuning with AWS Glue

## 1. Environment Setup and Configuration
[x] Set up AWS Glue development environment
[x] Configure Docker container with necessary libraries
[x] Set up MinIO as S3-compatible storage
[x] Configure GPU machine for fine-tuning tasks

## 2. Data Preparation
[ ] Analyze existing data sources
[ ] Design AWS Glue ETL job for data preprocessing
[ ] Implement data transformation to match OpenAI's fine-tuning format
[ ] Test and validate ETL job
[ ] Set up data pipeline to MinIO

## 3. OpenAI API Integration
[x] Study OpenAI's fine-tuning API documentation
[x] Implement Python functions for API interactions
   - Create fine-tuning jobs
   - Monitor job status
   - Retrieve fine-tuned models
[x] Develop error handling and retry mechanisms
[x] Create a configuration management system for API keys and endpoints

## 4. Fine-tuning Pipeline Development
[ ] Design the overall fine-tuning workflow
[ ] Implement data retrieval from MinIO
[ ] Develop fine-tuning job submission process
[ ] Create a monitoring and logging system for fine-tuning jobs
[ ] Implement model evaluation and validation procedures
[ ] Develop a system for managing and versioning fine-tuned models

## 5. Batch Processing Implementation
[ ] Design batch processing architecture
[ ] Implement batch job creation and management
[ ] Develop a system for handling large-scale fine-tuning requests
[ ] Create a mechanism for distributing batch workloads
